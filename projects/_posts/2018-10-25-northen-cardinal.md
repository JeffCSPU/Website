title: The Northern Cardinal model airplane
---

I've never been that much of an aviation nerd, but building a model airplane has long been on my bucket list. What happened is I stumbled across the [FliteTest][ftyt] YouTube channel where they build all sorts of crazy planes. The idea of building something that can fly really got into my head, but the model building hobby has a high cost of entry and I wasn't sure whether it would really stick with me. Fortunately a good friend of mine already had some experience and some parts laying around and he was kind enough to give me a push in form of a plane building kit plus he let me borrow his transmitter. The plane I got was designed by a local (Hungarian) engineer nicknamed Styroman who runs a CNC cutting business at [3dhabvagas.hu][3dhab]. The model is called EPP Ultimate and it is available to buy as a kit [here][eppulti]. There are barely any instructions, but with some advice from my friend and the workers of a [local model parts store][jako] I managed to figure it out in the end. I decided to paint the plane red and black for better visibility in the sky. Because of this colour scheme, I decided to name the plane Northern Cardinal because that's what came up when I Googled "red bird". Overall I'm very pleased with how it turned out and can't wait for its maiden flight.
