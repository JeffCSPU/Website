title: Unity Grating Shader
---
I have made a custom Unity shader for rendering grating patterns to GameObjects or the whole screen. The pattern it generates is commonly used by neuroscientist as a visual stimulus since it activates direction and orientation selective cells in the visual cortex. Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/gergely-xyz/UnityGratingShader).
