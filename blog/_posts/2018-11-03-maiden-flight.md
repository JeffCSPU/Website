title: Maiden flight
---
The weather finally got better so we went to the local model airport to test out the model airplane I built. It did fly, but I have to admit, not very well. Fortunately we bumped into a local builder/pilot and he gave some valuable feedback and lent us some parts for testing. Turns out the whole plane is a bit underpowered. We will need a bigger motor, a beefier BLDC driver/ESC and probably a 4 cell LiPo instead of the 3 cell one. This would shift the CG a bit forward, but the plane was a bit tail heavy to begin with.
